# Contributing to Njord

We love contributions! However, note that it's important that you first talk to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/AbK57nAGv8) about what you are planning to do so we both save time and effort. 
If it's only bug fixes or documentation, feel free to send PR, those are more likely to pass directly. 

## Copypasta for license when adding new files

For all new files we create please add the license to the top of the files, see `njord/src/sqlite/mod.rs` for an example.
